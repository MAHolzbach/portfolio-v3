  "detailsResults": "A failure! Surprisingly, this site actually slightly lowered revenue during A/B testing, and was therefore not launched.",
  "detailsComments": "The payment page is a very large Java code base that has been around for years. It uses Java, Springboot, HTML, CSS, Sass, and Javascript. We did not have the time budget to completely rebuild the site, so we had to build on top of it. Pulling off this redesign was a first class lesson in code organization, especially the CSS/Sass and Javascript/jQuery. I'm still very proud of my CSS work on this in particular. But it wasn't meant to be; slightly decreased revenue led to this project being declared a failure.",
