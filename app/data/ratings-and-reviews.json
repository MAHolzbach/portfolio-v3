  "detailsComments": "This code base was an inherited one, and had sat untouched for nearly three years. Accordingly, the tooling in particular was badly out of date, and the Redux code was a bit overly complex (it had been one of Carfax's first React/Redux projects and was a little over-engineered). I pushed to take a step back from expanding this application until we could fully update the tooling and simplify some of the state management. After a significant overhaul under the hood (a significant Webpack and Redux learning experience), Mike Dolan and I proceeded to work closely with the data team that manages the review data to implement new endpoints we could use, and bring this useful new feature to life.",
